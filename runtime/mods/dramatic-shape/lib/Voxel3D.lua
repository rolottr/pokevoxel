-- Voxel world mode: the 3D pass -- shader, depth buffer and camera.
--
-- World space is world PIXELS, so every coordinate the 2D paths already
-- compute drops straight in with no unit conversion:
--
--   +X  map east   (world-pixel x)
--   +Y  up         (0 is the ground plane)
--   +Z  map south  (world-pixel y)
--
-- A character at rest faces +Z, i.e. toward a camera parked to the south,
-- which is what "facing down" means in the 2D game -- and a character card
-- is drawn in exactly that pose, leaning back rather than yawing.
--
-- The camera orbits the view centre at Voxel.angle: 0 is straight down
-- (what the flat 2D view already is) and 50 degrees leans toward the
-- horizon. Distance and field of view are tied to Voxel.FOCAL, which is the
-- same constant Tilt projects with, so a given angle frames the world
-- identically in both modes -- switching between them changes the geometry,
-- not the framing.
--
-- Every GPU object is pcall-guarded and `available()` reports the result:
-- headless test runs and any driver without depth-canvas support fall back
-- to the existing tilt/flat paths rather than erroring.

--
-- A caller with matrices of its own -- the immersive eyes, whose view comes from
-- a tracked pose and whose projection is an off-centre frustum no
-- eye/focus/fov triple can express -- sets `view` and `proj` instead, and
-- the eye/focus fields stay for everything that reasons about the camera
-- rather than projecting with it (setLook, the sky, the water's lean).
--
-- The orbit is the free-roam camera and it is described entirely by ONE
-- number, the pitch, because that is all a camera following the player over
-- their own map ever needs. A staged shot -- the overworld battle's
-- over-the-shoulder rig (see BattleCam) -- is a placed camera: it has a yaw,
-- it does not sit above its focus, and its framing comes from the arena
-- rather than from the view size. Rather than widen the orbit into
-- something that could express both and be the wrong shape for each, a
-- caller with a camera of its own simply hands it over.
--

-- and the overlay all read Voxel3D.vp / Voxel3D.eye, which are set the same
-- way either way.

--
-- Two facts about the view direction, set alongside the eye and the focus

-- it:
--
--   lookFlat   the view direction flattened onto the ground plane and
--              normalized -- "the way the horizon lies from here", which is
--              what a reflection leans toward at the steeper rungs (Water).
--   descent    how far below horizontal the view runs, as a sine: 0 looking
--              level, 1 looking straight down. It is the number that says
--              whether there is a horizon in frame at all, and it answers
--              the same way for the orbit and for a placed battle camera --
--              which is why this is derived from the two vectors rather than
--              read off Voxel.angle, a rung the battle camera does not have.

-- and lookFlat then keeps whatever it last held rather than becoming a zero

-- never allowed. So the figure is drawn a second time with the test
-- INVERTED: "greater" passes exactly where "lequal" failed, and LOVE hands
-- the compare straight to glDepthFunc, so the two are true complements.
-- Every texel of the sprite is therefore drawn once and once only -- solid
-- where it is visible, translucent where it is not -- with no seam where
-- they meet and no double-blending anywhere.
--
-- Nothing is drawn at all when nothing is in the way, and no code here ever

-- ------------------------------------------------------- the water pass --
--
-- A reflective surface has to READ the frame it is being drawn into: the
-- colour of what is standing around it and the depth that says where. Both
-- are attachments of the target this pass is bound to, and a texture cannot
-- be sampled while it is one -- so for the length of the water draw the
-- frame is taken apart:
--
--   the COLOUR is copied to a mirror canvas, which is a texture like any
--   other and is what the reflection samples.
--
--   the DEPTH is simply detached. The water shader does the test itself
--   against the texture (see Water), which is the same comparison the
--   hardware would have made -- what it gives up is depth WRITES, and water
--   is flat, never overlaps itself, and has nothing drawn under it later.
--
-- `paint`, when given, is called with the MIRROR bound and the scene shader
-- set, to add things that must be REFLECTED without being composited yet.
--
-- The characters are the whole reason it exists. Gen 1 draws people over
-- the world and water is world, so the cast has to composite AFTER the
-- water -- but a reflection can only contain what was drawn BEFORE it, and
-- a lake with everyone standing beside it and nobody in it reads as glass.
-- Painting them into the mirror alone settles both: they are in the picture
-- the water reflects and not yet in the picture the water is drawn into.
--
-- They go down depth-TESTED and depth-WRITE-FREE. Tested, so a figure behind
-- a building is behind it in the reflection too; write-free because the very
-- next thing to read that buffer is the water's own depth test, and a cast
-- that had written to it would punch itself out of the water it is standing
-- beside.
--
-- Returns the two sampleable textures, or nil when there is nothing to hand
-- over: no readable-or-packed depth path on this driver, or no pass open.
--
-- MUST be paired with endWater, which puts the frame back together.

-- the colour target. This is used only by the packed browser path, whose
-- temporary internal attachment does not survive a target switch. Colour is
-- masked completely; the submission changes depth and nothing the player sees.
