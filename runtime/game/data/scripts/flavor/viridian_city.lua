-- Viridian City flavor dialogue (pokered/scripts/ViridianCity.asm).
-- Ports the text_asm bodies for GAMBLER1, YOUNGSTER2 and GIRL.
--
-- Not ported here (already handled elsewhere / not talk-reachable):
--  * TEXT_VIRIDIANCITY_FISHER (TM42 gift) -- already ported as a
--    `gift()` entry in data/scripts/story5.lua's M.VIRIDIAN_CITY.talk.
--  * TEXT_VIRIDIANCITY_OLD_MAN (the walking man at (17,5)) and
--    TEXT_VIRIDIANCITY_OLD_MAN_SLEEPY (the sleeper at (18,9)) -- both
--    live in data/scripts/story.lua, which owns this map's onStep gate
--    and can reach the `old_man_demo` command for the real catch
--    tutorial.  Keep them there: story.lua loads BEFORE this file, so a
--    duplicate here would silently win the merge.
--  * TEXT_VIRIDIANCITY_GYM_LOCKED -- a step-triggered blocking text
--    (ViridianCityCheckGymOpenScript), implemented by story5.lua's
--    onStep chain (viridianGymLock -> viridianOldManStep) for this map.
